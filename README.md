A sample readme to match database of this study

## Description
To determine the proportion of patients who received a treatment for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) among those presenting a discordant Clostridioides difficile diagnostic assay and to identify patient characteristics associated with the decision to treat CDI.

- Treatement (yes=1) 
  - Patients were considered as treated for CDI if they fulfilled all of the following criteria: 1) an appropriate antibiotic treatment administered for CDI according to published guidelines5 8 14; 2) treatment introduced less than 48 h before the results of tests; 3) treatment duration of  ≥10 days or still under treatment at time of death; and 4) treatment prescribed with a written decision in the EMR for CDI treatment, or without an alternative indication for its prescription. Of note, as fecal microbiota transplantation is not performed at our centre, it was not retained in the outcome definition.

- Delay between test result and treatment introduction (days)
  - negative value: treatment introduction before test result 
  - positive value: treatment introduction after test result
